HOW TO INSTALL:
Create a folder named "Custom" in your TF2 directory if you do not already have one. C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\

Place the HUD folder inside that custom folder

To get the custom font to work properly, install the days.ttf font included to your computer. (With windows7 this can usually be done by just double clicking the file)

Known Bugs:
The Class/Team Indicator can not be seen on lower resolution games. I will support this eventually, but to change it yourself edit the resource/ui/Hudplayerclass.res in notepad. Change the xpos and ypos of "playerstatusclassimage" and "playerstatusspyimage" until it is in a position you like. A lower xpos moves the icon to the right (its on the bottom left)

When disguising as a spy, class indicators for all classes will get disabled. Reloading the HUD does not fix this, I have no idea why this is suddenly an issue.

This HUD will not work on a MAC. I'm not sure anything can be done about this, but I'm certain I can't do it.
